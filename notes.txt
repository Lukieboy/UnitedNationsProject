1. Goal 14 supports the deveolopment and expansion of renewable energy sources, including offshore wnid farms, and marine solar installations. By harnessing clean and renewable energy from the oceans, this can help take Climate Action, using renewable energy instead of using fossil fuels.<br><br>

2. Sustainable Fisheries: Goal 14 promotes having sustainable fisheries and protecting fish stocks. This also aligns with some of Goal 13's objectives, such as having secure food sources and livelihoods, while minimizing the environmental impact of fishing activities. <br><br>

3. Climate Resilience: The main goal of Life Below Water is to enhance the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems, which are quite vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification and natural disasters.  By helping to protect these ecosystems, Goal 14 helps to improve part of Goal 13, keeping healthy and resilient ecosystems.


1. Ocean-based Renewable Energy: Goal 14 supports the development and expansion of renewable energy sources such as offshore wind farms and marine-based solar installations. By harnessing clean and renewable energy from the oceans, Goal 14 contributes to Goal 13's climate action objectives of transitioning away from fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
        2. Sustainable Fisheries: Goal 14 promotes sustainable fishing practices and the protection of fish stocks, aligning with Goal 13's objectives. By ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries, Goal 14 contributes to Goal 13's efforts to secure food sources and livelihoods while minimizing the environmental impact of fishing activities. Sustainable fisheries management practices, including measures to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, can also help reduce the carbon footprint of the fishing industry.<br>
      3. Climate Resilience: Goal 14 aims to enhance the resilience of marine and coastal ecosystems, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events. By implementing measures to protect and restore these ecosystems, Goal 14 supports Goal 13's objectives of climate adaptation and resilience-building, as healthy and resilient ecosystems can act as buffers against climate-related impacts.
